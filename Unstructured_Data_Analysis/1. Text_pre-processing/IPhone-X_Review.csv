what feature? face id? You're face scanned and recognized by apple and even the government save on their data base. Convenient for people who don't have issues with their privacy being compromise. I'd admit it has a powerful processor but the restriction, not open access a deal breaker for some people. If you're comfortable with IOS it's a good phone, the most powerful phone at the moment I'd say. The price you ask, I think their asking too much for the phone.

2. How long did you use the iPhone X? 5 mins in the shop? If so, your point is invalid. 
3. It does not include a fast charger. But that is just a little detail which does not mess up the whole phone. 
4. Stop being a fanboy. Accept that both phones are great phones and when you see somebody with an IPhone X, don?t say it is worse than yours. Just say they are both really good. And don?t think he is stupid because he/she paid 1000 ? for an iPhone, because you also paid 1000 ? for a phone which is not really different.",,,,

Your logic is flawed. They do slow down the older phones, but it isn't without a reason. Most older phones have been out for years and people have had them for years. I had the original six until I got the Iphone X. The problem is with ANY older phone is that because of apps using more than ever before in terms of RAM, Etc. Most phones don't last 6 hour let alone a day.
 
While I don't agree that Apple hasn't offered the choice, it is a clever decision because that if you look on Apple's top reviews is the main complaint(Apart from the price, but those complaints aren't really viable or relatable to this).
 
Please in future, do not post illogical and radical conclusions without first inserting the slightest bit on knowledge.
 
Have a nice day,

137,A great phone for whom who can afford it. I really don`t recommend just because of the price tag. ,,,,
138,"To sum up: The iPhone X is awesome device, and so are other iPhones. They maybe did had downsides like no wireless charging or lacks of features, but with recent iPhones that's not the case. Also the RAM managment and software optimization are unmatched. And security/privacy on iOS is much better too. 
But, now there is the catch. It does cost a lot, which is also even understandable because of what it brings to the table. But at this price ranges, there shouldn't be much to complain about. But there is, from non expanding storage to iTunes and now to Apple slowing down old models performance. Say whatever you want - but they do that to make money, to force you to upgrade to better phone. Slow charger you get with iPhone X or removal of headphone jack is just an example of it. From no customization which sucks, now we are coming to other stuff that Apple does to make more money out of you. The same goes with the insane costs to replace front and/or back glass on new iPhones. They are innovative, and they could make even better products, but they are more interested in profit. And that's the reason why I personally don't have an iPhone, even though I like iPhones",,,,

It reminds me of a sandwich I once purchased from a more upmarket and reputable brasserie.  It was a gloriously lush and plentiful bounty with an abundance of Ham and lashings of other meats and salad.  My friend told me it would be a waste of money but, after he saw it in all its glory he instantly regretted his choice of artisan parsnip soup with crusty roll.  The soup WAS good, don't get me wrong, but the glory of my sandwich overshadowed the whole affair. 
My friend even goes so far as to say that it is the BIGGEST regret of his adult life and that he has ordered the sandwich multiple times since then and that it has never been made to the same glorious standards as the first time he laid his envious eyes upon it.  He has since fallen out with me as I never let him taste even the smallest bite of this magical creation.  i have received several threatening emails and lewd phone calls asking me to explain the feelings associated with eating the sandwich of sandwiches.  I can only decline to do this as re-living this visceral experience will probably drive me to very edge of my own sanity, even the brief memory of the enticing aroma is enough to push me close to the greatest moment of my life and, in that moment, i maybe tempted to end my thoughts there and slip into the bliss that was the perfectly seasoned mayonnaise dressed Excalibur Sandwich, a Sandwich fit for a king.

202,"Iphone X deal has always been shady right from the beginning . Apple did a very bad business deal in India . Apple also created artificial hype and fake demand around it. In India Flipkart took deal for online sale . In the initial wave Flipkart may be had a stock of 1000 phones for the entire India .The entire pre order sold out in 3 minutes. Also the very day of the release the stocks went out in 5 minutes. People even went out and purchased the more expensive 256 GB in anticipation that Iphone X may not be available ever again. Well then reviews started pouring and and speed tests were live in Youtube and itit was the unanimous opinion that the mobile phone is unique and very good but never worth Rs 89000/- ( 1300 dollars for 64 Gb) . 1 month later the 2nd wave of sale took place and guess what , Iphone X is not selling like hot cakes anymore . Even worse that some websites have started giving discounts of 2000/- to 5000/- . Google understood its position and worth in the Indian market and Pixel 2 was discounted to Rs 39990/- . Long story short all those people who even travelled to Hong Kong so that they may sell in India at a profit made a royal fool of themselves. Apple also to rspect the Indian market and sell at a price not more than 65000/- . I guess another month more and the Iphone X will be discounted nevertheless.",,,,

Because LCD has limitations like missing clear black, also it uses more power. Not sure If tap to wake is possible with LCD? Atleast iPhone 8 didn't had one. Also always on display might come now when whole screen doesn't need to be on to do that.
 
AMOLED also have limitations but Apple beat most of them. If you compare iPhone 8 LCD and iPhone X screen, only thing where iPhone 8 is better is viewing angle colour shift. But even that iPhone X has best in the market from AMOLED screens.

No, they were afraid that they get those super punchy oversatured colours, iOS devices are big favourite among graphic and visual persons. We buy Apple devices because they offer best tools for graphic designers, photographers etc. Apple cares stuff like that, just like they care about musicians which are also big favourite among music people.
 
Apple is always provided best tools for us creative people. How you think i can edit photo If it the look is already sowmthing how i shot it? I have no idea how it will look after i send it to another device If the devices colors were wrong from the beginning. This is exact same why musicians doesn't buy punchy speakers, they buy studio monitors which offers most balanced and natural sound. Not having too punchy bass or too crispy high end, the sound has to be perfectly flat and natural and sorry in mobile phones, Samsung doesn't offer that. That's why Apple had to redesign the screen to make it look like Apple users are expecting.",,,,

For the iPhone X's Super Retina Display, which incorporates the first-ever OLED panel in an iOS device, Joswiak says Apple had to ""do a lot of engineering"" to come up with ""panels that were better"" to address traditional OLED issues like oversaturated colors. 
 
The iPhone X is using its own color management system, a folding panel design that stacks circuits for minimal bezel, and other technology improvements to outshine competing smartphone displays.""

I know some of these phones were released 1-1.5 years ago compared to iPhoneX and - with the exception of Google Pixel 2XL - they cost half as much as an iPhone while having similar or even better specifications. I mean, they all look good on paper, but I don't know how actually they are. If anyone has first-hand experience with any of these phones, I would really appreciate that.

I have X and then i have iPad Pro, Yes X have better screen. Both look very similar, just the colours are deeper and black is really black. If you take Android phone with OLED screen next to those, it doesn't look similar. You are going to see big differences.
 
Like i said Apple combined best of both worlds.
 
Im very surprised that you haven't seen this ""The iPhone X has the best smartphone display ever, says DisplayMate""
 
""According to DisplayMate, the iPhone X has the highest color accuracy of any smartphone display, the highest full-screen brightness for OLED smartphones, the highest full-screen contrast rating in ambient light, the highest contrast ratio, the lowest screen reflectance, and the smallest brightness variation with viewing angle changes. 
 
All of these earned the iPhone X's display the highest grade DisplayMate has ever awarded to any smartphone display,

When you watch videos in this way (not full screen) The black bars at the top and bottom look like BIG HUGE BEZELS ....... The phone kind of morphs into something like the bezel'd IPhone 8 Plus or the Sony ZX Premium

My advise would be to take it back as soon as possible, the quicker you do this the better.

""Apple claims the X has a 5.8"" screen... except it's not what you may imagine this to be. You can see on the official site that the 5.8"" measurement is for a rectangular screen while the X has rounded corners. But that's a minor quibble; the bigger issue is that there's a cutout at the top of the screen, which limits the usable area.""
 
""In fact, ignoring the top portion leaves a screen that's just about 18.5:9 in aspect ratio. If you were to show 16:9 content on it - the traditional widescreen format that all TV shows and YouTube videos use - you're left with what is effectively a 4.96"" screen. That's obviously bigger than the iPhone 8's but way smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus display.""

Personally I like the latest trend of 19.5:9 ratio (X) and the 18.5:9 (e.g Galaxy S8) but it comes at a price e.g Videos are stretched or to see the videos as intended you will have to put up with black bars either side of the video you are watching and in doing so you don't make use of the full screen. Also you may want to take the 'notch' into consideration too. 
 
The IPhone 8 plus offers the more traditional 16:9 ratio,  but its all about preference and I would advise that you check the phones out in person if the screen is the big deal breaker for you.

No lags or slowing down, a massive improvement over the s2 and also an improvement over the s4. I now have an s8 and it is just superb in every way - speed, screen, camera etc. It certainly suits my purpose and proves that competition eventually brings out the best in everything.

436,"The reason I stick with Apple year after year, even though they consistently fail to add or change features I would like and could have on an Android device, is stability. That?s it. I need my phone to work, consistently, especially for the core functions of a communication device - email, text, Internet, messaging apps, etc.  I switched from Android with the iPhone 4 because it blew every existing Android device away in terms of speed and reliability in daily use.  Benchmarks are and were irrelevant to me; they don?t console me when my phone freezes or reboots itself, when apps crash or fail to load or get sluggish, when messages mysteriously dissolve or fail to send.  These are problems I have never had on an iPhone. The ?it just works? factor becomes really important when you rely on a device for critical communication for business. These days there are really impressive Android phones that seem to beat the iPhone out of the gate, even in actual speed tests and daily use case scenarios. But I know people who actually own those devices and I *still* see them stutter and fail at important tasks on occasion - something I literally never experience as an iOS user. Yes, bugs have creeped into iOS in recent iterations (which have generally been quickly squashed). But nothing which has caused slowdown or failure of essential tasks. And Android phones suffer from another frustrating problem I?ve never experienced in iOS: slowdown over time. I?ve never had to fully restore an iOS device to get it running without lag again. Ever. But that seems to be commonplace among Android devices. O don?t have time in my life to be fiddling with my phone to get it running how I need it to work. Every cool and supposedly more convenient new feature that comes out on Android May seem like a reason to switch, but it always comes back to reliability for me. Over the course of my workday, I just need stuff to work how it should work when I want to use it, even if it?s a fairly vanilla version of the thing. That?s what keeps in in the iOS ecosystem.

The iPhone X is playing catch up with features android devices have had for years and at three times the price.

557,"Alex, 12 Nov 2017Iphone 8 and 8 Plus should be 7s and 7s plus
And iphone x should be iphone 8Yes I agree as I already said, Apple and Samsung were two of the last companies to hold the physical home button when everyone else adopted on screen buttons, this year both companies decided to get rid of home buttons in their flagships and what we got to know about each one's approach. 
Samsung removed the home button but tried to keep the overall experience same for its users. The back button on right side tho it can be changed to left now. A recent apps button and a 3d touch always on home button which wasn't seen in any phone till now, iPhone 7 had it but it wasn't embedded in the display itself. So a Samsung user coming from older models like S5, S6 or S7 will get almost the same experience. The fingerprint sensor was put to back this time but the phone can still be unlocked the same way, press the always on home button without waking up the phone while looking at the display and the phone will be unlocked in no time by the iris scanner giving an impression of inbuilt fingerprint sensor. The bottom navigation panel with back home and recent buttons can be hidden easily by two taps tho the home button will still be functioning on pressing the area where it's embedded giving the same experience of physical home button while watching videos, playing games and using any app. The overall experience was enhanced by options like swipe down anywhere on display for notification panel and swipe up anywhere for apps, these settings can be changed according to taste.  
The other one is Apple which being the first company to bring 3d touch and a 3d touch home button in iPhone 7 strangely couldn't implement an always on 3d touch home button in display in their most premium phone till date. What they came up with is a swipe up line which is a user nightmare. To ruin it more there are things like swipe down from left of notch for notification, from right of notch for control center. The experience is no where near what people are used to and what they'll be using in future when inbuilt fingerprint sensor will come. The unlocking takes more time now due to the swipe even after face verification. Apple's rushed software approach for an anniversary edition makes an arrogant image of Apple. They are saying like'' if you want a phone which has demanded features samsung's display and bezel-less design then you'll have to pay extra and will have to accept unfinished non practical software. Otherwise keep buying what we are giving you from years and don't complain ''. I think and everyone thinks that iPhone x was supposed to be the main device of the year, they could name it as iPhone 8,X or anything but it was supposed to in the place of iPhone 8 as the next iPhone. It's a direct competitior to S8 which is a usual successor of previous device not an anniversary edition sold at premium price. Apple + amoled and unfinished software can't make it a more expensive device than the current iPhone of the year. I'm sure iPhone 8 and 8 plus users who will spend a flagship amount will be left with a device which even the company doesn't approve as their current flagship. IPhone 8 wasn't supposed to come this year. IPhone x was supposed to be the main device.",,,,

They could choose more expensive curved displays (570 ppi as in S8) but Apple decided to save cost and put a normal display in a curved glass panel which could easily fit a curved display as rumored earlier. Apple did the software tweaks and now the display is same as a lcd which means you get a lcd like oled with added risk of burn ins and lines as the software isn't revamped to avoid burn ins like Samsung do by slightly moving icons and buttons and moving always on features to avoid burn ins. Iphone x lcd like oled will definitely eat up eyes. ",,,,

Of course when you have a massive user base making big changes means bringing those users with you. Yes things will probably change a bit based on user feedback, this is a Gen 1 product, and yes the software will catch up with the hardware - Animoji is just a fun proof of concept to push developers to come up with their own ideas.
 
Having finally got one (thanks istocknow.com for the live stock pushes!) my initial thoughts are this. Screen is something else. Oled looks very good, but Ive noticed my iPad Pro screen looks better in any light than my 6S plus scree, and this seems to prove Truetone/HDR is key.
 
I admit I was a bit worried about losing Touch ID but amazingly FaceID seems to work at least as well as TouchID (shame you cant register two faces - I guess the bionic ML hardware isnt fast enough - A12 anyone - or the software isnt up to it yet?), and its quicker to setup.
 
Speed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device but no comparison to a DLSR (though those can be thousands with good lenses!). However, its a big improvement on the 6S plus and I thought that had a good camera. 
 
Is it worth the equivalent price of a 12 next week inch MacBook? Thats a personal decision but if you dont want to spend quite that much but want an iPhone, the iPhone 8 (and even 7) are mighty good phones with most of the functionality and very good LCD screens. But if you really really really want a X then consider the Apple Upgrade Programme. Its a way of paying monthly, its 0%, you get Applecare Plus, and you can upgrade to the Gen 2 product next year if you want or just continue paying it off.",,,,

Android was bearable - a little annoying at times (with unexplained delays) - but was fine..
 
Then moved iPhone... Thought it is the greatest - I was wrong.. Even for basic operations - I was severely constrained. For instance, how do I take a backup of Photos physically (File copy) to PC ? It was virtually impossible unless you do it the ""iTunes"" way... And the backup to iCloud ? I paid close to USD1150 for this phone. And yet, I need to pay a subscription cost to iCloud - just for photo backup.. I paid unwillingly. 
 
Go to iTunes, they try to hard sell Apple Music .. I just don't need it. 
 
Let's not talk about Windows anymore.. It is more or less irrelevant. But it did much better job than the present day iPhones.

Redmi Note 4 is (true) not officially water or dust resistant, but features 1GB more RAM than X. Camera is good enough, 4K videos at 30fps are not a problem.

No stereo speakers, true, but unneeded. No NFC, true, but most cards are unsupported so not really needed. 
No wireless charging, true, yet still it's not practical and voice recognition is governed by Google or third parties.

807,"IMO, it's better if the phone directly goes to home screen after successful Face ID unlock than manually swiping it. I really don't care about my lockscreen. It's just for security purposes against unwanted users. They have done this since iOS 10 Touch ID though there's a workaround for iOS 10.

Its fast smooth interface and no issues of any lags of apps 
Its small really small but full screen so its cool using one hand and good bright clear display so far the best 
It does heat up in continuous use can feel it 
No issues in sound output its loud 
Face id is ok working and all these animoji and all r ok 
The front camera portrait mode is something that i think is the best feature  
Everything is just fine but  
Go for the iphone 7 plus or 8 plus or  
the samsung note 8 and huawei mate 10 
As even though i have it in my family they have these and can do a lot more than this iphone

I got this phone yesterday and set it up at home when I do not wear my specs. This morning I have been using it and setting it up from scratch (did not want to restore from iP7+) and so far not once it failed to open even when I was outside sitting and my specs were darker (photochromic). I wont say it is a perfect phone, but put the unfavorable comments where it belongs - 
- iPhone 7+ lasted a full day, iPX am charging now after 12 hours where 6 hours was not in use. and these 6 hour of up time is where full time screen was on. 
- looks like battery % is gone  that was a useful item and I miss it. 
- face id bit slow if you wait for it to unlocking than swap to go to apps, best way to unlock is to swap up immediately without waiting for Faceid this then have similar effect as touch id where moment u touch, it takes you to the apps. 
- I still think the screen sq mm area would be in par with my ip7+ 5.5 inch screen as that one is wider than iPX. Did not feel any area gain, but good to be back to one hand operation.
