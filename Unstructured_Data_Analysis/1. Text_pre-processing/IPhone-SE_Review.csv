4,This is my second iphone after iphone 4s. I?ôve been a long time android user in between. I?ôll tell you who this phone is for. Prospective buyers can then decide1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality. You would be amazed how many people shoot Youtube videos on an iPhone. The only downside is that the display doesn?ôt do justice to the photos and videos you have taken. Night photos are ...READ MORE

8,"If you are going to use apple for first time then you will be amazed. Performance wise this phone is ultra first. Camera is also pretty good, attached images were taken indoor only. Display is also quite good. The BEST thing about this phone is it?ôs size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.The worst thing is it?ôs battery. Doesn?ôt last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off.READ MORE"

10,"People talk about it?ôs battery backup?? man I?ôm in love with this handset. So clean, so smooth. Smoother than xr if you?ôve used both you?ôll understand. Camera better than xr. Battery of xr is better but still I?ôll vote for se because of A13 Bionic chip, touch haptics and many more reasons. Its a beast in this segment. Still I want you all to feel this beast in your hand. Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece.READ MORE"

12,"Camera is best. Mobile performance is good. 4.7 inch display phone is handy phone. Battery capacity is not good but in this range phone is good . Dual sim phone and one sim slot supported eSim. Better series in iPhone is X ,XS ,XR and 11. Software iOS 14.3 is latest.READ MORE"
13,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...READ MORE"

Battery of the phone is good. It easily lasts 1 day with full day usage of internet like mails, apps, photos, surfing, etc and calling also.

22,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with...READ MORE"
23,"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand.

As such phone is fine and camera is good, however there is serious issue with iPhone se 2020 regarding connecting to wi-fi, which I was not aware of before purchasing.

But without playing games and without watching online videos such as in YouTube, it gives me one and half day battery backup till date in full volume and 50% brightness configuration and along with some common modification in settings.

Always carry a power bank just to be on the safer side.READ MORE"
